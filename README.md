# prosopagnosia
This is a aid to help people with prosopagnosia.
# Introduction
Prosopagnosia is a face recognition disorder. It prevents people from recognizing others by face but usually, there are no problems with the ability to recognize objects. This is generally considered a memory problem, but in fact, it is not. What doctors think is that there is a fold in the fusiform gyrus which causes this problem. About 2.5% of the world's population has this disorder. Inability to recognize faces is also a side effect of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
# My Solution
My idea is that the person with facial blindness will wear a camera that uses a small earpiece to tell the users who the person that is in front of them is. The camera will take a picture and use software and algorithms to detect a face, then recognize who he is and inform the person.
